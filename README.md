### Project Summary

**Cinema Curry** is a web application initially created to explore the intersection of South Asian film culture and digital product design. The project emphasizes clean UI development, mobile-first responsiveness, and interactive media presentation. It includes features such as a structured cart system, detailed product metadata, and a streamlined checkout experience.

This repository represents the **beta version**, which laid the groundwork for what is now branded and developed further as **cineX** — a more advanced, chatbot-integrated, and technically modular iteration.
